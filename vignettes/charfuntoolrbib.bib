The new method is applied to a number of complicated integrals, among them the solution to a problem in viscoelasticity. Some convergence results for this method are presented.},

The performance of the algorithm is compared with open-source and commercial software solutions with arbitrary precision, and for many cases the algorithm achieves high accuracy in both the real and imaginary parts. Our motivation comes from the need for accurate computation of the characteristic function of the Arcsine distribution or the Beta distribution; the latter being required in several financial applications, for example, modeling the loss given default in the context of portfolio credit risk.},

The fractional Fourier transform and the corresponding fast algorithm are useful for such applications as computing DFTs of sequences with prime lengths, computing DFTs of sparse sequences, analyzing sequences with noninteger periodicities, performing high-resolution trigonometric interpolation, detecting lines in noisy images, and detecting signals with linearly drifting frequencies. In many cases, the resulting algorithms are faster by arbitrarily large factors than conventional techniques.},

Many models are estimated by procedures that lose their good statistical properties when the underlying model slightly deviates from the assumed one. Robust statistical methods can improve the data analysis process of the skilled analyst and provide him with useful additional information. For this anniversary issue, we discuss some aspects related to robust estimation in the context of extreme value theory (EVT). Using real data and simulations, we show how robust methods can improve the quality of EVT data analysis by providing information on influential observations, deviating substructures and possible mis-specification of a model while guaranteeing good statistical properties over a whole set of underlying distributions around the assumed one.},

In yet another publication [6] this method was shown to be applicable to divergent oscillatory infinite integrals that are defined in the sense of summability. The application of the \$W\$-transformation involves some asymptotic analysis of the integrand as the variable of integration tends to infinity. In the present work the \$W\$-transformation is modified so as to keep this asymptotic analysis to a minimum, involving only the phase of oscillations. This modified version, which turns out to be as efficient as the original \$W\$-transformation, can also be applied to convergent or divergent oscillatory infinite integrals other than those dealt with in [4] and [6]. The convergence properties of the modified transformation are analyzed in detail for the integrals of [4] and [6], and numerical examples are provided.},

  abstract = {The actuarial and insurance industries frequently use the lognormal and the Pareto distributions to model their payments data. These types of payment data are typically very highly positively skewed. Pareto model with a longer and thicker upper tail is used to model the larger loss data, while the larger data with lower frequencies as well as smaller data with higher frequencies are usually modeled by the lognormal distribution. Even though the lognormal model covers larger data with lower frequencies, it fades away to zero more quickly than the Pareto model. Furthermore, the Pareto model does not provide a reasonable parametric fit for smaller data due to its monotonic decreasing shape of the density. Therefore, taking into account the tail behavior of both small and large losses, we were motivated to look for a new avenue to remedy the situation. Here we introduce a two-parameter smooth continuous composite lognormal-Pareto model that is a two-parameter lognormal density up to an unknown threshold value and a two-parameter Pareto density for the remainder. The resulting two-parameter smooth density is similar in shape to the lognormal density, yet its upper tail is larger than the lognormal density and the tail behavior is quite similar to the Pareto density. Parameter estimation techniques and properties of this new composite lognormal-Pareto model are discussed and we compare its performance with the other commonly used models. A simulated example and a well-known fire insurance data set are analyzed to show the importance and applicability of this newly proposed composite lognormal-Pareto model.},
